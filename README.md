# Project-new-media-2016

Hello, my name is Sander Vervaeke and I'm a Belgian student NMCT.
This is my first ever project created in Unity, I really enjoyed working in Unity and definitly will work on more projects in the future.

Project info:

The project uses four different scripts for its functionality. 
Please consider that this project isnâ€™t perfect yet and is subject to change.

-	FpsController script: this script is a basic first-person controller using the Wii mote rather than mouse and keyboard. This script uses Flafla2's Unity - Wiimote lib. 
-	Drawing script: a script for drawing lines in Unity using the LineRenderer.
-	ColorPicker: a basic RGBA user interface color selector.
-	GameLogic: just a basic script telling the other scripts what to do and handeling some user interface elements.
