# Project new media 2016

Hello, my name is Sander Vervaeke and I'm a Belgian student NMCT (new media and communication technology).
This is my first ever project created in Unity, I really enjoyed working in Unity and definitly will work on more projects in the future.
This project was created for the course new media where we learn to create applications in combination with hardware like: Kinect, Wii, Arduino, Leap-motion.…

Project info:
It’s a fun little project that allows you to draw around you using the Wiimote.
The project uses four different scripts for its functionality. 
Please consider that this project isn’t perfect yet and is subject to change.

-	FpsController script: this script is a basic first-person controller using the Wii mote rather than mouse and keyboard. This script uses Flafla2's Unity - Wiimote lib. 
-	Drawing script: a script for drawing lines in Unity using the LineRenderer.
-	ColorPicker: a basic RGBA user interface color selector.
-	GameLogic: just a basic script telling the other scripts what to do and handeling some user interface elements.
